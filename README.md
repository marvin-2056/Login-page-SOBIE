# SOBIE Registration
## Goal: To make the registration process user friendly
The current website registration feature is **ok** but we can implement something better.
- Our thought process is to have the user input their name and email and select the event they want to register for(usually it will be the conference) then submit the form.
- Once the form is submitted the user will then be redirected to a confirmation page that will load the hardcoded information of the event and a map API that will display the location of the event.
- We want to then have the user exit and go back to the home page.
